- Font pairing: 'Belleza' for headings and 'Alegreya' for body text.
- Use delicate line icons related to beauty, bridal, and education to create a cohesive theme. Consistent stroke weight and simple shapes.

- Subtle transitions and animations, such as fading effects or gentle scrolling, will make the site experience pleasant.
